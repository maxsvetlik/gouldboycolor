/* Handles all hardware interrupts
 *
 * Timers are typically stored in memory.
 * There are two main registers that handles this: 
 *      IME specifies if interrupts are enabled
 *      IF specifies the interrupts requested by devices
 *
 * IF's map looks like this
 * 0xFF0F  IFflag 
 * Bit 0: V-Blank  Interrupt Request (INT 40h)  (1=Request)
 * Bit 1: LCD STAT Interrupt Request (INT 48h)  (1=Request)
 * Bit 2: Timer    Interrupt Request (INT 50h)  (1=Request)
 * Bit 3: Serial   Interrupt Request (INT 58h)  (1=Request)
 * Bit 4: Joypad   Interrupt Request (INT 60h)  (1=Request)
 *
 * This also specifies the interrupt priority in the case of collisions.
 * In order for an interrupt to be executed, the IME flag must be set, and the requested interrupt (set via IF) must exist in the IE flag, at location FFFF.
