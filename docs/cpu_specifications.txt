/* This file briefly describes aspects about the cpu implemented by z80.c
 *
 * This CPU is not a Zilog z80, nor an Intel 8080, but is roughly equivilent to the
 * Panasonic Hybrid chip ( )

 Registers:
    8, 8-bit registers: A,B,C,D,E,H,L
    These can be combined to create a 16-bit address in the following forms:
    + AF
    + BC
    + DE
    + HL

    2, 16-bit registers: SP (stack pointer), PC (program counter)

    Flags:
        +Zero Flag - Set for ALU ops or 2 values match when CMP is run
        +Subtract Flag - Set if the last math op was a subtraction
        +Half Carry Flag - Set if a carry occured from the lower nibble in last ALU op
        +Carry Flag - Set if carry occured in the last ALU op or A is the lower reg in a CMP op


Memory:
    The CPU is 8-bit but with a 16-bit SP. Thus there are 2^16 addressable memory entries.
